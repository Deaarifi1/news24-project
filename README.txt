# News24 Web Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was originally developed as a group assignment for a university course focused on HTML and CSS.
The initial version consisted of static pages that implement the layout, navigation, and visual design of a news website.

After the completion of the HTML/CSS course, the project was extended individually by adding PHP functionality as part of another university subject.
The PHP layer transforms the project from a static website into a dynamic web application with database interaction, user sessions, form handling, and server-side logic.
